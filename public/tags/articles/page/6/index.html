    <p>Status:<br>
You can likely tell that I&rsquo;ve been having some fun with graphing and mapping recently. I was reading a few articles about GIS and stumbled upon a pretty darn cool project at <a href="http://www.webopticon.com/projects/neighborhood_nets">Webopticon</a>, which included cool pictures. I showed it to my girlfriend thinking she would find it interesting, and then realized: oh! KML has an altitude attribute. That could be interesting.<br>
One of my projects is to create <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/2007/12/sydneys-driving-habits.html">maps of Sydney&rsquo;s traffic</a><a href="http://www.blogger.com/"></a>, so I have been experimenting heavily with Mapnik and OSM. I figured I could have some fun and finally parse some gps tracks and display the data.<br>
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/bkhs8KqkZyS7yIoA6AeNnA?feat=embedwebsite"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi8Ju2Qv3TAIupmzBjORZ5wUBGjxIlwZ_0mrPb0Mku5Yob6_ldYEmtRO0GP_kQ62-aZDZ3fP8_vh6nfXv9NpP5X98oneS25YXXf9Tr-pD1RMkp7l_jbDBWBsqxrA5hIDhH8KvfVjZI0TvGc/s288/gpstracks3.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I first started off trying to play around with the KML files my gps logger natively stores. After a while I realized it shouldn&rsquo;t be this hard to parse the XML, and realized it also stores data in gpx format. I opened up one of the gpx files and immediately saw how much easier it would be to work with. I quickly created a parser for the xml in Python (using the dom method, yet I think I&rsquo;m going to rewrite it using sax), and then with the aid of <a href="http://zcologia.com/news/584/better-python-practices-for-the-geoweb/">an article</a> by Sean Gillies, converted the needed objects into KML. I used the speed attribute (with some magnification) as the altitude, and voila, a pretty picture.<br>
This picture is as Victoria Road crosses James Rouse Drive &ndash; a spot that is always congested in the morning.<br>
I&rsquo;ll likely post some code shortly, I would like to rewrite the parsing section to use something event-driven &ndash; hopefully it will be a little faster.</p>

    <p>My new guest VMs under Xen seem to be having issues where upon each reboot, the network interface gets incremented by 1. For instance, it starts at eth0, then goes to eth1, then eth2, and eventually ethX. There are two issues to fix: 1) get the count back to 0, and 2) stop it from counting again.</p>
<p>I was able to get them to decrease by looking in the /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules file and removing all entries.</p>
<p>Next, I was able to prevent this by simply inserting a MAC address to the interface in the configuration. For instance, one of my domU&rsquo;s has this entry:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>vif         = \[ &#39;mac=00:D0:59:83:DC:B5,bridge=xenbr0&#39; \]
</code></pre><p>Lastly, I made sure (as I would with any server) to create an entry in the /etc/network/interfaces file.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.1.16
gateway 192.168.1.1
netmask 255.255.255.0

    <p>I have finally decided to do another remodel of this site. I had a few goals before starting:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use one image</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the YUI-CSS framework</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use Django</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make it easily extendable</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So far, I think I&rsquo;ve accomplished these goals. The site is easier to read, easy to modify, and has a few new features. More entries to come!</p>

<pre tabindex="0"><code>mysqlcheck -r -uUsername -pPassword databasename comments\_freecomment

First, go to the location where your databases are stored on the disk (most likely something like /var/lib/mysql/databasename).

<pre tabindex="0"><code>myisamchk -r comments\_freecomment

    <p>Yesterday I was sort of curious if I could use my 3 Skypephone in a pinch if I got lost, which here in Sydney, happens quite often. Luckily 3&rsquo;s Skypephone has both Bluetooth, and supports j2me apps. Mobile GPS unit, here I come.</p>
<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/3AY6h-qKwGk9NpnB9hrwsw?feat=embedwebsite"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjExWMS7zKJdGCG_1MHdpb900yTseLCrbHerf2PlfzwSouqfnmJHr5V1jiIcDcbMrEul2OZUFlCYOQhTgrq_3C-cYDWmxkx-yDOr6NNwokX8P-gUikt3DSjxRi11qJrMuP4_aSRLpjhLPax/s288/DSC03368.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The recipe to get maps on your Skypephone is pretty darn easy. You&rsquo;ll need one dash bluetooth GPS receiver (I have the <a href="http://www.qstarz.com/Products/GPS%20Products/BT-Q1000.html">Qstarz BT-Q1000</a>), <a href="http://linuxtechs.net/kruch/tb/forum/index.php">TrekBuddy</a>, a TrekBuddy acceptable map (<a href="http://osm.bandnet.org/browse/?1,1,1,0">easily downloadable</a>), and one dab computer &ndash; but since you&rsquo;re reading this, I figure you&rsquo;ve got that part taken care of.</p>
<p>My process is as follows (on Linux): plug in your Skypephone and select &ldquo;usb storage&rdquo; on your phone. Drag the TrekBuddy.jar file onto your new mounted drive (mine comes up as KINGSTON). Drag a relevent map downloaded from bandnet.org onto your phone as well. Unplug your phone from the USB, and it will scan for new media. Hit Menu -&gt; My Stuff -&gt; Others and scroll down to treckbuddy.jar &ndash; hit Run. Go to your Connectivity settings and turn on bluetooth. Next go to Games and Apps and downloaded apps, start TrekBuddy. Press the key above MENU and select Load Map, and choose the map you uploaded to your phone. Now hit Start. Select the GPS device, and you&rsquo;re in business!</p>
<p>There are more instructions <a href="http://linuxtechs.net/kruch/tb/forum/viewtopic.php?t=91">here</a> and also <a href="http://linuxtechs.net/kruch/tb/forum/viewtopic.php?t=22">here</a>.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been playing around with <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.com">OSM</a> a little lately, and have been meaning to construct my own slippy map. At first I wanted to do it on my VPS &ndash; but with rather limited storage, and even more limited memory, there just isn&rsquo;t a way. Three problems exists: the first occurs when trying to use osm2pgsql to import the OSM file into the database. Current records state that this typically uses 650+ MB, something my 512MB VPS just doesn&rsquo;t have (although I&rsquo;m writing some code that might make this possible in the future).</p>
<p>The second problem exists with CPU usage. Processes on my VPS don&rsquo;t really utilize the CPU much, which means renicing the process doesn&rsquo;t do a thing. The CPU pegs at 100%, as it is supposed to do, except that the VPS auto-kills processes that stay at 100% for any length of time. Luckily somebody wrote a program called &ldquo;cpulimit&rdquo; (apt-get install cpulimit) that will cap the CPU usage for a process.</p>
<p>The last problem that I thought about is <em>what if</em> I could uncompress the file. Would that use less memory to stick it in the database? I searched and searched but couldn&rsquo;t find an answer to how big the actual .osm file is. I ultimately broke down and decided to spend the 50c it would take to get this all done with EC2, and write some scripts to automate it in the future.</p>
<p>However, since I&rsquo;ve finally uncompressed the .osm, I can tell you that as of about January 1st, 2008, the uncompressed OSM size is 67GB.</p>

<p>I have to admit, I&rsquo;m pretty lazy. I don&rsquo;t (ironically) like to type, and I really don&rsquo;t like typing the same command over and over. I found myself switching between my external monitor and laptop quite frequently, and decided to somewhat automate the task. Although I know there are other programs out there that allow this, they either had too many features, or crashed. Xrandr works just fine, but like I said, I&rsquo;m lazy&hellip;</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Zenity">Zenity</a>. Initially I created a PyGTK monitor switcher, yet wanted something even simpler. If you aren&rsquo;t in the know, Zenity allows you to create super fast, super simple dialogs to regular commands. After you click &ldquo;ok&rdquo;, the command is executed, and the dialog disappears. Perfect for switching displays.</p>
<p>And here is the simplistic code behind it:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>#!/bin/sh

ans=$(zenity  --list  --text &#34;How do you want to switch your monitor?&#34; \\
--radiolist  --column &#34;Pick&#34; --column &#34;Output Type&#34; TRUE LCD FALSE VGA \\
FALSE Both);

if \[ &#34;$ans&#34; = &#34;LCD&#34; \]
then
xrandr --output VGA --off
xrandr --output LVDS --auto
elif \[ &#34;$ans&#34; = &#34;VGA&#34; \]
then
xrandr --output LVDS --off
xrandr --output VGA --auto

# Background

If you ask most kids how to be healthy, they'll give you a pretty simple answer: eat healthy food, sleep well, and do exercise. Let's focus on the sleeping part.

Ever after reading *Why We Sleep* I've been trying to increase the quality of my sleep. I believe I've made significant progress over the previous few years, and I'm getting better at coping when there are especially strong challenges, for example when travelling.

I use my Garmin to track my sleep, so I must admit upfront that I am aware it isn't perfect. Stage tracking in all wearables is reported as being not great, however, I'm hopeful that at least duration and activity are somewhat accurate.

Good news is my duration is pretty spot on (around 7hr on average), and my average time awake is decent (usually under 5 minutes per night). My average sleep score has been increasing over the years, and increased in the last 3 months. Here are some graphs that show the change:

(INSERT GRAPHS)

When looking on r/Garmin you'll see a number of people asking how to sleep better, so I figured I'll post a few things I've found. Some of the below are about what I've done so far to improve my Sleep Score, and not necessarily my sleep. Hopefully that makes sense.

* First off, follow the NSF suggestions. [list some of them]
* This might sound basic, but, look at your average time you fall asleep and average time you wake up, and set your schedule as 10 minutes after, and 10 minutes before.
* Avoid doing a breathwork activity within 30 minutes before bed. I find that I often fall asleep, which is great, *except* the watch is then stuck in Activity mode, and won't move on to Sleep mode. Even if I don't fall asleep and I manage to end the activity, it still sometimes has a delay of a few hours to get to Sleep mode. Feeling like you never woke up but end up wit ha 61 sleep score isn't great. Robbery!
* The more self-aware I've become, the little things I've started to notice. For example, weight training has a significant impact on my reported stress levels, and that flows on to my Sleep Score. I now no longer do any weight training after 1pm.
* Pay special attention to what food you consume, how much, and when. I've found that a lot of carbs for dinner causes my Stress levels (according to garmin) to elevate for a long time, and that I believe has a flow-on impact to Sleep Score. Additionally, I've found that if I eat a big carb meal and get startled at some point, then my body wakes up ready go. Perhaps no surprise then that the only time I've received a 100 score I was easing in to a 5 day fast, and had only had 1100 calories that day.
* Speaking of how much food, I try to eat as many calories as possible before noon, and with dinner I try to aim to eat it around 4pm and have it be under 500 calories.
* I've found that I don't do well when sharing a bed with anyone or anything, be that a partner, my daughter, or even a puppy dog. I now almost always sleep by myself on a King Single.
* At 5pm I aim to disassociate from work, so I close any work browsers, and disable any work email/chat profiles on my phone.
* Then there's the 3-2-1 rule:
	* Starting around 3 hours (i.e. 6:30pm) before my target time to sleep I stop eating and start winding down, which involves me putting one some cheap blue light blocking clip-ons, and making one last chamomile tea with 5-10g of glycine and 1g of NAC. I also take any evening supplements, none of which I think help with sleep. I've been experimenting with Tart Cherry Extract, yet I don't know if it helps in any way. I'll update when they run out.
	* Starting around 2 hours before bed time I stop doing chores or anything that's potentially stressful.
	* And 1 hour before bed I try to stop using my phone or watching TV and read a book.
* Generally eliminated stimulants, so all I have is decaf coffee; no sodas, and I am careful about tea consumption.
* And

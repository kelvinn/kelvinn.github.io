# Background

If you ask most kids how to be healthy, they'll give you a pretty simple answer: eat healthy food, sleep well, and do exercise. Let's focus on the sleeping part.

Ever after reading *Why We Sleep* I've been trying to increase the quality of my sleep. I believe I've made significant progress over the previous few years, and I'm getting better at coping when there are especially strong challenges, for example when travelling.

I use my Garmin to track my sleep, so I must admit upfront that I am aware it isn't perfect. Stage tracking in all wearables is reported as being not great, however, I'm hopeful that at least duration and activity are somewhat accurate.

Good news is my duration is pretty spot on (around 7hr on average), and my average time awake is decent (usually under 5 minutes per day). My average sleep score has been increasing over the years, and significantly increased in the last 3 months. When looking on r/Garmin you'll see a number of people asking how to sleep better, so I figured I'll post a few things I've found. Some of the below are about what I've done so far to improve my Sleep Score, and not necessarily my sleep. Hopefully that makes sense.

* First off, follow the NSF suggestions. [list some of them]
* This might sound basic, but, look at your average time you fall asleep and average time you wake up, and set your schedule as 10 minutes after, and 10 minutes before.
* Avoid doing a breathwork activity within 30 minutes before bed. I find that I often fall asleep, which is great, *except* the watch is then stuck in Activity mode, and won't move on to Sleep mode. Even if I don't fall asleep and I manage to end the activity, it still sometimes has a delay of a few hours to get to Sleep mode. Feeling like you never woke up but end up wit ha 61 sleep score isn't great. Robbery!
* The more self-aware I've become, the little things I've started to notice. For example, weight training has a significant impact on my reported stress levels, and that flows on to my Sleep Score.

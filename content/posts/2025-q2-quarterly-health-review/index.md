### Reflection

A challenging quarter, as I spent three three weeks travelling; it took me at least a week to start feeling normal in each direction, and much longer to recover. Additionally, because I was leaving for such a long time, I think my work/life balance suffered prior to the trip. However, physical health isn't the only thing that matters, and I think travelling helped me and my family grow.

I finished some more Longevity-related books, like *Longevity Leap*, and then also *The Art of Dying Well*. I've also started learning more from [Michael Lustgarten](https://michaellustgarten.com/). In particular I like his minimalist approach and lifestyle, and that he prioritises whole foods over supplements.

### Experiments / Focus Areas

This quarter I had a four areas I wanted to focus on:

1. **Improve fitness** by training more. My goal is to get above a 75 fitness score on intervals.icu, and still maintain 3+ gym sessions per week.
2. **Gain weight** by starting to track my food in Cronometer, again, and not eating out anymore. 
3. **Sleep better** by improving my sleep hygiene (starting wind down by 8pm, in bed by 9pm, wearing red light glasses at night, and increasing glycine consumption before bed). I also experimented with taking Magnesium Glycinate before bed.
4. **Reduce Stress** by being mindful of when I eat my meals, and what meals I'm consuming. Additionally, wherever possible, avoid evening meetings.

Let's go through what I experimented with, and the result.
#### Improve Fitness

My main forms of exercise remain running and strength training. There are two tools I use:

1) Garmin's Intensity Minutes (and other metrics)
2) intervals.icu

Both of these tools help warn me of overtraining, but also lets me see the impact of my planned workouts. For example, as of today (7-May-2025), here is my plan for the rest of the quarter and showing the previous two years of training:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250507041747.png)

My goal was to get above a 75 fitness score according to intervals.icu without injury, and to average above 800 'intensity minutes' according to Garmin. In Intervals.icu, the "fitness" score, also known as Chronic Training Load (CTL), is¬†==a measure of your average training load over the past six weeks==.
##### Results

* Fitness score of 75 or above ‚úÖ
* Average intensity minutes of 800 or above ‚úÖ
* Improve Vo2Max ‚úÖ
* Decrease RHR ‚ùå

So, how'd I do? Let's look at the previous 3 months in intervals.icu. My goal was to get above 75 'fitness':

Here is what my 'intensity minutes' look like for the previous 12 months, which also shows my dip in Dec/Jan while I was travelling, and to a lesser extent in April when I was travelling again:

My fitness routine remains similar to the previous quarter.

**Vo2Max/RHR:** My average resting heart rate was N. My Vo2Max according to Garmin is now slightly above N.
#### Gain Weight

##### Plan

My previous DEXA saw body fat % decrease, but also a slight decrease in lean muscle mass. This is somewhat confusing to me, as I'm lifting heavier than ever before, but apparently that can be purely neuromuscular.

I'm also confused because my weight hovered between 76 and 78kg for the previous 12 months.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250510071012.png)

Regardless, to increase muscle I need to be in a calorie surplus, and I suspect that when things get busy, given I try to avoid eating out (as well as how expensive it is!), I sometimes don't get enough calories. 

Enter Cronometer. I had previously used this tool to look at my micronutrient profile, so I could fill those gaps with supplementation, so I resumed using it this quarter. The below image is from early May targeting 80kg by the end of June.

Early on I was having trouble hitting the calorie target, as can be seen from this random day of food tracking from Cronometer.

We can see from this that my protein consumption is adequate. I still wished to remain on a whole foods plant based diet wherever possible. Unfortunately, I'm not really driven by food, and I don't believe my mood is negatively impacted by being in a slight calorie deficit; in fact, I generally don't even notice besides perhaps my runs being harder, or potentially not sleeping as well. This means that without tracking my consumption it is difficult for me to be in a surplus.

Towards the end of June I started to dial in meal prepping, and getting in a better habit of what foods to bring. By the end of the quarter I was almost able to even hit my calorie targets even on long run days, which is up to 5000 calories!
##### Results

* Increase weight  ‚úÖ
* Increase muscle  ü§∑
 
I gained weight almost exactly as Cronometer predicted, which is exciting. I didn't need to do any major tweaks to my diet, just a few extra calories per day. I have a hypothesis that too many extra calories (e.g. 300+) starts to impact my sleep, so sticking in the 100-200 extra calorie range seems to be the right zone to build muscle, but also still be able to sleep well.

#### Experiment: Fasting Mimicking Diet

About three years ago I read Longo's Longevity Diet, and it helped me form a foundation about nutrition. Ever since reading it I have been wishing to do a FMD, but training, travel, or life always got in the way. I decided it might be a good match to try and eat slightly in surplus, and then do the fast once I hit the goal weight. 

Exactly as per the plan I added about 2-3kg by the end of June, so decided to go ahead with the fast. Coincidentally ProLon, the company that helps make FMD kits, had a 30% sale, so I got my kit and chose the week to give it a go.

I did a 14 day fast when I was a teenager _based on a dare_, so somewhat knew what to expect: the first few days aren't great, but then your body adapts and things are easier. However, this time the fast was actually backed by science, and I had the privilege to be able to use a glucose/ketone meter to track my progress. You can see how I did in this chart:

(insert chart)

Overall the fast went well, and I don't think I burned any bridges by being too moody! I stopped running during the five days, but I continued going to the gym to prevent muscle loss.

Did it work? What does work even mean? Can I even measure autophagy?

I don't know the answers, but we can at least look at biomarkers to see if they got worse. How soon should I test after a thing like this without screwing up the results? I remember reading that people after Ramadan had significantly increased biomarkers, so I found the paper and in their methodology the researchers waited 8-12 days before testing.

After waiting 8 days I was able to take my blood test, and discovered that my PhenoAge (what I found out)!

#### Sleep better

##### Plan

Although 

* Become more strict with when I eat breakfast and dinner. Breakfast between 5:30am and 6:30am, and dinner between 4:00pm and 6:00pm. Do not deviate.
* A small complex carb snack before bed? Chickpeas?

##### Results

* Improve sleep quality ‚úÖ

### This Quarter's Supplement Stack

Some principles that I tried to follow:

- Avoid bill burden
- Wait until a supplement is on the ITP supported interventions page
- Have a biomarker in mind that a certain supplement will change.

And here's what is currently in my stack:

| Morning                    | Ad Hoc / Evening            | Ad Hoc         |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------- |
| Fish Oil (6g)              | Magnesium Glycinate (150mg) | B Complete     |
| Niacin (50mg)              | Glycine (5-10g)             | Iron (20mg)    |
| Calcium (333mg)            | NAC (1g)                    | Vitamin C (1g) |
| Vitamin D (33mcg)          | Astaxanthin (7mg)           |                |
| Vitamin K2 mk7 (100mcg)    |                             |                |
| B12 (1000 mcg)             |                             |                |
| L-Methylfolate  (1000 mcg) |                             |                |
| Lysine (1g)                |                             |                |
| Zinc (5mg)                 |                             |                |
| Hyaluronic Acid (200mg)    |                             |                |
| Iodine (150mcg)            |                             |                |

I swapped out the B Complete with a B12 (methylcobalamin) and L-Methylfolate combination. I've added in iodine (via kelp) now, too, given I'm essentially on a vegan diet and don't eat much salt.

When looking at Cronometer the only vitamin that I am routinely shot on is Vitamin A, so I need to figure out a way to get that in my diet. If possible I will prefer to get it via food instead of supplement.

My [Nutty Pudding](nutty-pudding-modified-recipe/index.md) also has TMG (500mg), Creatine (3g), Pea Protein (25g), and HCP (15-25g).

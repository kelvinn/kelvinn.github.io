### Experiments / Focus Areas

This quarter I had a few experiments.

1. **Train more** by getting up to N fitness score on intervals.icu, and get in the gym 3-4 times per week. 
2. **Sleep better** by meditating before bed, starting wind down by 8pm, wearing red light glasses at night, and increasing glycine consumption before bed. I also experimented with taking Magnesium Glycinate before bed.
3. **Gain weight** by switching up to oatmeal before my run, and then have my regular bread + nut butter + banana *after* my smoothie but *before* lunch.

#### Train More

Here is what my 'intensity minutes' look like for the previous 12 months, which also shows my dip in Dec/Jan while I was travelling.

(Add intensity minutes)

And then the previous 3 months in intervals.icu. My goal is to get to 80 Fitness and stick there for the rest of the season.

(Add intervals chart)

My target fitness routine remains similar to the previous quarter.

### This Quarter's Supplement Stack

Some principles that I tried to follow:

- Avoid bill burden
- Wait until a supplement is on the ITP supported interventions page
- Have a biomarker in mind that a certain supplement will change.

And here's what is currently in my stack:

| Morning                 | Ad Hoc / Evening            |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Fish Oil (6g)           | Magnesium Glycinate (150mg) |
| Niacin (50mg)           | Iron (10mg)                 |
| Calcium (333mg)         | Vitamin C (500mg)           |
| Vitamin D (33mcg)       | Glycine (5-10g)             |

### Reflection

A challenging quarter, as I spent three three weeks travelling; it took me at least a week to start feeling normal in each direction, and much longer to recover. Additionally, because I was leaving for such a long time, I think my work/life balance suffered prior to the trip. However, physical health isn't the only thing that matters, and I think travelling help me and my family grow.

I finished some more Longevity-related books, like *Longevity Leap*, and then also *The Art of Dying Well*. I've also started learning more from [Michael Lustgarten](https://michaellustgarten.com/). In particular I like his minimalist approach and lifestyle.

### Experiments / Focus Areas

This quarter I had a four areas I wanted to focus on:

1. **Improve fitness** by training more. My goal is to get above a 75 fitness score on intervals.icu, and still maintain 3+ gym sessions per week.
2. 3. **Gain weight** by starting to track my food in Cronometer, again, and not eating out anymore. 
3. **Sleep better** by improving my sleep hygiene (starting wind down by 8pm, in bed by 9pm, wearing red light glasses at night, and increasing glycine consumption before bed). I also experimented with taking Magnesium Glycinate before bed.
4. **Reduce Stress** by TBC

Let's go through what I experimented with, and the result.
#### Improve Fitness

My main forms of exercise remain running and strength training. There are two tools I use:

1) Garmin's Intensity Minutes (and other metrics)
2) intervals.icu

Both of these tools help warn me of overtraining, but also lets me see the impact of my planned workouts. For example, as of today (7-May-2025), here is my plan for the rest of the quarter and showing the previous two years of training:

My goal was to get above a 75 fitness score without injury, and to have above 800 'intensity minutes'.
##### Results

* Fitness score of 75 or above ✅
* Average intensity minutes of 800 or above ✅
* Improve Vo2Max ✅
* Decrease RHR ✅

So, how'd I do? Let's look at the previous 3 months in intervals.icu. My goal was to get above 75 'fitness':

Here is what my 'intensity minutes' look like for the previous 12 months, which also shows my dip in Dec/Jan while I was travelling, and to a lesser extent in April when I was travelling again:

My fitness routine remains similar to the previous quarter.

**Vo2Max/RHR:** My average resting heart rate was N. My Vo2Max according to Garmin is now slightly above N.
#### Gain Weight

##### Plan

My previous DEXA saw me decrease body fat %, but also decrease lean muscle mass. This is somewhat confusing to me, as I'm lifting heavier than ever before, but apparently that can be purely neuromuscular.

Regardless, this simply means consuming more calories than I expend, and making sure my protein consumption is adequate. I still wished to remain on a whole foods plant based diet wherever possible. Unfortunately, I'm not really driven by food, and I don't believe my mood is negatively impacted by being in a slight calorie deficit. This means that without tracking my consumption it is difficult for me to be in a surplus.

Enter Cronometer. I used this tool previously to look at my micronutrient profile, and seeing where there might be gaps that I would fill with supplementation, so I resumed using it this quarter.

##### Results

* Increase weight  ✅
* Increase muscle ?

#### Sleep better

##### Plan

* Become more strict with when I eat breakfast and dinner. Breakfast between 5:30am and 6:30am, and dinner between 5:00pm and 6:00pm. Do not deviate.
* A small complex carb snack before bed? Chickpeas?

##### Results

* Improve sleep quality ✅

### This Quarter's Supplement Stack

Some principles that I tried to follow:

- Avoid bill burden
- Wait until a supplement is on the ITP supported interventions page
- Have a biomarker in mind that a certain supplement will change.

And here's what is currently in my stack:

| Morning                 | Ad Hoc / Evening            |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Fish Oil (6g)           | Magnesium Glycinate (150mg) |
| Niacin (50mg)           | Iron (10mg)                 |
| Calcium (333mg)         | Vitamin C (500mg)           |
| Vitamin D (33mcg)       | Glycine (5-10g)             |
| Vitamin K2 mk7 (100mcg) | Astaxanthin (7mg)           |
| B Complete              |                             |
| Lysine (1g)             |                             |
| Zinc (5mg)              |                             |
| Hyaluronic Acid (200mg) |                             |

My [Nutty Pudding](nutty-pudding-modified-recipe/index.md) also has TMG (500mg), Creatine (3g), Pea Protein (25g), and HCP (15-25g).

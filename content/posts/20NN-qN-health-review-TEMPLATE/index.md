### Reflection

Add a reflection here. 
### Focus Areas

As usual, there are four areas that I wanted to focus on:

- *Improve fitness* by training more. My goal is to get above a 75 fitness score on intervals.icu
- *Sleep better* by improving my sleep hygiene and experimenting with meal timing.
- *Reduce Stress* by examining meal composition and avoiding anything that might impact my sleep
- *Improve Biomarkers* by looking at my nutrition, as well as the above items.

Overall most metrics are improving, as we can see with the following key metrics.

Over the previous year we can see that:

We can see correlations for the quarter with the below correlation matrix.

Looking at the correlations, here's an analysis of the relationships and whether they make intuitive sense:

Let’s go through how I did this quarter and what I experimented with.
#### Improve Fitness

##### Goals  

- Average intensity minutes (Garmin) of 800 or above ✅
- Improve Vo2Max ✅
- Decrease RHR ✅
##### Analysis

I look at intensity minutes as a way to make sure I'm getting enough fitness, regardless if I'm running or at the gym or kayaking. My goal is 800 minutes per week 80% of the weeks, which is significantly higher than the commonly recommended 150 minutes per week. The reason I've chosen to say "80% of the weeks" is because there are some weeks when I need to travel for work, and it is harder to reach this target.

My average intensity minutes for the quarter was was [INSERT AVERAGE INTENSITY MINUTES] per week.

In addition to load we can have a look at Resting Heart Rate, as that is often related to sufficient recovery.

And let's look at Vo2Max, which stayed roughly the same this quarter.

##### Experiments

#### Improve Sleep
##### Goals
- Improve sleep quality ✅
##### Analysis

Let's have a look at my sleep scores since buying my Garmin:

And then when comparing each quarter this year we can see some trends with each day of the week.

[INSERT ANY OBSERVATIONS]
##### Experiments

I conducted a few sleep-related experiments this quarter, including:

- [INSERT ANY SLEEP EXPERIMENTS]

Overall I'd consider these experiments a success.
#### Decrease Stress

##### Goals
- Decrease stress ❌
##### Analysis
Let's have a look at stress per quarter grouped by day of the week:

[INSERT OBSERVATIONS ABOUT STRESS]
##### Experiments

No stress-related experiments for the quarter.

#### Improve Nutrition

##### Goals
- Stick below 20g of saturated fat per day ❌
- Get between 110 and 125g of protein per day ✅
- Get over 70g of fibre per day ✅
- Meet 100% coverage of micronutrients ❌

So, why am I not at 100%? Let's look at areas where I can improve.

[LOOK AT AREAS TO IMPROVE]

#### Improve Biomarkers

##### Goals
- Decrease IGF-1 ❓
- Decrease MCV ❓
- Decrease RDW ❓
- Increase Albumin ❓
- Decrease hsCRP ❓
##### Analysis

(Blood panels still to be taken)
##### Experiments

I did have a fair amount of experimentation here, including:

- [INSERT ANY EXPERIMENtS]

Because of subscribing to Cronometer I'm able to get more reports, such as my Nutrient Balances and Nutrient Targets, which have encouraged me to tweak the food I eat.

### Supplement Stack

Some principles that I tried to follow:

- Avoid bill burden; prefer food over pills.
- Wait until a supplement is on the ITP supported interventions page, or has significant evidence behind it
- Have a biomarker in mind that a certain supplement will change

And here's what was in my stack for Q3:

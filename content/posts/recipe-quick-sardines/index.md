### Background

My primary goal here is to boost Omega 3, B12, and Calcium. This is generally the only meat that I'll consume outside of travel.
### Ingredients

- 1 can 120g sardines in olive oil
- 2 large garlic cloves, minced
- ½ tsp dried oregano
- Pinch of low sodium salt
- Ground pepper

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 250°C    
2. Put sardines in an oven-proof tray
3. Cover with garlic
4. Sprinkle the oregano, kosher salt, and pepper on top.
5. Cook the sardines for approximately 15 minutes until they get nice and roasted on top. There is no need to flip the fish while it cooks.
6. Put on a plate and eat with a few crackers.

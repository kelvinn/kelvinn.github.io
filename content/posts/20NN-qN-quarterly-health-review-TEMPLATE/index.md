### Reflection

Add a reflection here.
### Focus Areas

As usual, there are four areas that I wanted to focus on:

- *Improve fitness* by training more. My goal was to maintain a fitness score above 70 on intervals.icu
- *Sleep better* by {add summary of any experiments}.
- *Reduce Stress* by {add summary of any experiments}.
- *Improve Biomarkers* by looking at my nutrition, as well as the above items.

Overall most metrics are improving, as we can see with the following key metrics.

![Summary Chart](summary.png)

Over the previous year we can see that:

* Resting Heart Rate is **decreasing** ✅
* Stress is **decreasing** ✅
* Steps are **maintaining** ✅
* Body Battery (max/day) is increasing ✅

We can see correlations for the quarter with the below correlation matrix.

Let’s go through how I did this quarter and what I experimented with.
#### Improve Fitness

##### Goals  

- Weekly intensity minutes (Garmin) of 800 or above 80% of the time ✅
- Improve Vo2Max ✅
- Decrease RHR ✅
##### Analysis

I look at intensity minutes as a way to make sure I'm getting enough fitness, regardless if I'm running or at the gym or kayaking. My goal is 800 minutes per week 80% of the weeks, which is significantly higher than the commonly recommended 150 minutes per week. The reason I've chosen to say "80% of the weeks" is because there are some weeks when I need to travel for work, and it is harder to reach this target.

I hit my intensity target {INSERT PERCENTAGE} of the weeks this quarter.

In addition to load we can have a look at Resting Heart Rate, as that is often related to sufficient training. We can see that my RHR continues to trend downwards.

##### Experiments

I didn't have any fitness-related experiments this quarter; just rinse and repeat.
#### Improve Sleep
##### Goals
- Improve sleep quality ❌
##### Analysis

Let's have a look at my sleep scores for the previous few years, averaged per quarter:

And then when comparing each quarter this year we can see some trends with each day of the week.

#### Decrease Stress

##### Goals
- Decrease stress ❌
##### Analysis
Let's have a look at stress per quarter grouped by day of the week:

##### Experiments
No stress-related experiments for the quarter.
#### Improve Biomarkers

##### Goals
- Decrease IGF-1 ❌
- Decrease MCV ✅
- Decrease RDW ✅
- Increase Albumin ✅
- Decrease hsCRP ✅
##### Analysis

##### Experiments

I did have a fair amount of experimentation here, including:

### Supplement Stack

Some principles that I tried to follow:

- Avoid bill burden; prefer food over pills.
- Wait until a supplement is on the ITP supported interventions page
- Have a biomarker in mind that a certain supplement will change

And here's what is currently in my stack:

| Morning                     | Evening           | Ad Hoc            |
| --------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Niacin (50mg)               | Astaxanthin (7mg) | Iron (20mg)       |
| Calcium (333mg)             | Glycine (5g)      | Vitamin C (500mg) |
| Vitamin D (4000 IU)         | NAC (1g)          |                   |
| Vitamin K2 mk7 (100mcg)     | Fish Oil (6g)     |                   |
| B12 Methyl (1000 mcg)       |                   |                   |
| B12 (Liposomal, 1000 mcg)   |                   |                   |
| L-Methylfolate  (1000 mcg)  |                   |                   |
| Lysine (1g)                 |                   |                   |
| Zinc (5mg)                  |                   |                   |
| Hyaluronic Acid (200mg)     |                   |                   |
| Iodine (150mcg)             |                   |                   |
| Creatine (3g - in smoothie) |                   |                   |
| TMG (2g - in smoothie)      |                   |                   |
|                             |                   |                   |
Here are the changes that I made this quarter:

* {DISCUSS ANY CHANGES}

If we're going to discuss supplements, then we should probably also discuss nutrition!
### Nutrition

{INSERT SOMETHING ABOUT NUTRITION HERE?}

### Focus For Next Quarter

I think the next quarter will remain similar to this one. I've subscribed to Cronometer, so I'm getting some additional insight from that. I'm contemplating dropping the following supplements, as it appears as though I am getting enough from food:

* Calcium
* Fish oil
* Lysine

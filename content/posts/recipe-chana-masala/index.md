### Background

The primary goal here is to increase my lycopene consumption, as I was noticing this is one of the antioxidants that Cronometer reported as me needing to focus on.
### Ingredients

* 2 cans chickpeas, drained & rinsed
- 2 large onions, finely chopped
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 2-inch piece ginger, grated
- 140g tomato paste (concentrated lycopene hit)
- 2 cans (400g) crushed tomatoes
- 2–4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil (for absorption)
- 2 tsp cumin seeds
- 2 tsp ground coriander
- 2 tsp turmeric
- 2 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp chili powder (optional, adjust to spice tolerance)
- 1 tsp black pepper (enhances absorption of antioxidants)
- 1 tsp lite salt
- Fresh coriander (cilantro), chopped (folate boost)

## Directions

* Heat olive oil in a pan. Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle. Add onions, cook until golden.  Stir in garlic + ginger. Cook 1–2 min until fragrant.  
* Add tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, and spices (coriander, turmeric, garam masala, chilli, black pepper). Simmer ~10 min → this cooking step boosts lycopene bioavailability.  
* Use an immersion blender to blend
* Stir in chickpeas and 1/2 cup water. Simmer 15–20 min, stirring occasionally, until thickened.  
* Finish with lemon juice and lots of fresh coriander.
* Divide in to 6 servings.
